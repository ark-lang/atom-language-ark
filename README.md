# atom-language-ark

This repo contains the `language-ark` package for Atom which add supports for the [Ark programing language](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark).

Currently, all the package does is add syntax highlighting, but other things such as snippets will come once the language is more fleshed-out.

## Installation
You can find language-ark by searching in the Atom packages view. Or, to install from the command line:
```
apm install language-ark
```
